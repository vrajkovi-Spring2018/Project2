                Create a Basecamp post for the group describing your work.
                Title the post with the same group name and project 3. Your post should include the names of your group members and the
                following&#x3a;
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Testing script with a welcome to your participant, an explanation of the process, and an outline of the exact
                    tasks you will be asking participants to complete.

                  <li>Testing notes + 3 major issues per participant.</li>
                  <li>A group-authored recommendation report on the three most pressing issues identified through your testing, including:
                    <ul>
                      <li>an explanation as to why the issues you’ve selected are most pressing.</li>
                      <li>possible approach to implementing fixes/improvements to address the issue.</li>

                Test your site with three different participants <b>not</b> in our class. At least one
                participant should use a mobile device (phone or tablet); at least one should use a
                traditional device (desktop or laptop)
              </li>
              <li>
                When possible, have participants use their own devices (but have a backup device ready

                Figure out how to best involve online students in your group who cannot be present on
                campus for testing; include those details in your site plan
