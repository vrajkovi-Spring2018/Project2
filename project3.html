                Create a Basecamp post for the group describing your work.
                Title the post with the same group name and project 3. Your post should include the names of your group members and the

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Testing script with a welcome to your participant, an explanation of the process, and an outline of the exact
                    tasks you will be asking participants to complete.

                  <li>Testing notes + 3 major issues per participant.</li>
                  <li>A group-authored recommendation report on the three most pressing issues identified through your testing, including:

                Test your site with three different participants <b>not</b> in our class. At least one

                traditional device (desktop or laptop)
              </li>
              <li>
                When possible, have participants use their own devices (but have a backup device ready

                Figure out how to best involve online students in your group who cannot be present on
