            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
              You will create a compelling single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new
              users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an
              open-source community. Focus on designing for an effortless, engaging entry of personal
              information; and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed,
              missing, or incomplete information. The goal of this project is to experiment with
              patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re
              offering, which is not at all an easy task.

                Create a Basecamp post describing your work
                in progress. Title the post with your name and project number (example Daniel Krieglstein: Project 1). Your post
                should include the URL to your GitHub repository, live link (GitHub pages), and two questions eliciting feedback on from fellow students.
              </li>
              <li>
                Give constructive comments to help at least three other students.
              </li>
              <li>
                Edit your original basecamp post under Project 1
                by fixing your code based on feedback from the professor and fellow students.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Add a 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point

                  <li>
                    Only structural, semantic uses of HTML elements and attributes. <b>Absolutely no</b>

                  <li>

                    event attributes in your HTML, in other words; attach events to any elements
                    requiring interaction)

                  <li>

                  <li>
